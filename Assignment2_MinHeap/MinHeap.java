	 * size: Input array size from the First line of input text
	 * The operations to be implemented:
	 * 1. buildMinHeap: Build the MinHeap
	 * 2. downHeap: Algorithm downheap restores the heap-order property by swapping key k along a downward path from the root. 
	 * 3. upHeap: The upheap process is used to add a node to a heap while maintaining the Heap property.
	 * heapSort and printMinHeapArray helper functions are added for generating the desired output.
